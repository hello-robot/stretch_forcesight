# Be careful with length_mm values. Stickers and printouts can vary
# significantly from your expectations. You should measure them
# directly. For example, in a prototype robot the stickers were closer
# to 23mm wide than 24mm. This 1mm difference resulted in > 1cm of
# error in the depths for the marker pose estimates when only using
# RGB images.
